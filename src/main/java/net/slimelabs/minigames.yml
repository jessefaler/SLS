# Instructions for setting up minigames:

# 1. World Reset Configuration:
# If 'reset-world' is set to true, you need to place a copy of the world folder in a
# folder named 'reset-world' located in the minigames server directory.
# Ensure the world folder's name matches the 'level-name' in the server.properties file.
# The default 'level-name' is 'world'.
# It is recommended to set 'reset-world' to true for minigames.

# 2. Java Version Configuration:
# Some servers might not be able to use the default java version.
# In such cases, you need to download a compatible java version and place the folder
# inside the 'java_versions' directory in the 'sls' plugin folder.
# Follow the steps below to do this:
#   a. Visit 'https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/archive/' and select the version you need.
#      Download the Compressed Archive for your machine.
#      If you are using WitherHost, which runs on Linux, download the Linux Compressed Archive.
#   b. Navigate to the 'sls' plugin folder and drop the Compressed Archive into the 'java_versions' folder.
#      Extract the archive and open the folder.
#   c. Find the 'java.exe' file inside the 'bin' folder.
#      Copy the local directory path from the server folder to the 'java.exe' file.
#      It should look something like this: '../../java_versions/jdk-14/bin/java.exe'
#      (For Linux, remove '.exe')
#   d. Paste this path into the 'custom-java-version-path' field in the 'minigames.yml' for your minigame.
#      Ensure 'use-custom-java-version' is set to true.

# Minigame Configuration Example:

    - name: 'Makers Wars' # Name of the game
      authors: 'MineMakers Team' # The player(s) or team that made the game
      max-players: 12 # The maximum number of players a game can have
      min-players: 1 # The minimum number of players a game can have
      ram-allocation: '1gb' # Amount of RAM to allocate. Can use 'gb', 'mb', 'kb'
      reset-world: true # Whether to reset the server world on start (recommended)
      use-custom-java-version: true # Whether to use a custom java version
      custom-java-version-path: '../../java_versions/jdk-14/bin/java' # Path to the custom java version
      server-folder-path: './plugins/sls/minigames/makers_wars' # Path to the server folder for this game
